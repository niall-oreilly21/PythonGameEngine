## Project Structure
This project includes a game engine and a 2D game in Python using pygame interface. The classes are based on object-oriented principles. The game will incorporate objects from the game engine to define how they behave. The hierarchy of our classes is that objects in the scene are called GameObject and they have a list of Components, for example:
- Animator
- Renderer
- MovementController
- Collider
- RigidBody
- etc.

We also have Manager classes for example:
- SceneManager which defines the active scene e.g., Main Menu, Pause Menu, etc.
- RendererManager to draw all renderers on the screen
- etc.

We use some of the inbuilt functionalities from pygame such as the main game loop and its vector class.

## Rules of the Game
+ The main objective of the game is to fight each enemy on each world until all enemies are defeated.

+ Each time the player is hit by an enemy their healthbar decreases.
